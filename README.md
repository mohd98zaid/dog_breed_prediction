#Dog Breed Prediction
This repository contains code for a dog breed prediction model. The model is built using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

##Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

##Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.

Open the Jupyter Notebook file named 02 dog breed prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Set up the required dependencies by running the following code in the notebook:

python
Copy code
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

!mkdir dog_dataset
!kaggle datasets download catherinehorng/dogbreedidfromcomp
!unzip dog_dataset/dogbreedidfromcomp.zip -d dog_dataset
!rm dog_dataset/dogbreedidfromcomp.zip
!rm dog_dataset/sample_submission.csv
Execute the notebook cells step by step to train the model and evaluate its performance.

##Dataset
The model is trained on the "Dog Breed Identification" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. The dataset contains images of various dog breeds, and the goal is to predict the breed of a given dog image.

##Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The architecture is as follows:

Input layer: Accepts images of size 224x224x3.
Convolutional layers: Consist of multiple convolutional layers with different filter sizes and activation functions.
Max pooling layers: Used to downsample the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Flatten layer: Flattens the feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense layers: Fully connected layers with different activation functions.
Output layer: Produces the predicted probabilities for each dog breed class.
Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. The training and validation accuracy are plotted over the epochs.

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, and the accuracy over the test set is calculated. Additionally, a random test image is shown along with the original and predicted dog breed labels.
